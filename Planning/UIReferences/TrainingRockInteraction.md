## Training Rock Interaction

![Training Rock Interaction](../images/ui/training-rock-interaction.png)

- Pedestal displays requirement text (`X Power OR Y Rebirths`) and reward per hit.
- When player approaches, an `Interact (E)` prompt appears; pressing it auto-positions the player and starts swings.
- Training is separate from mining: no blocks break—only swings against the rock.
- High requirement rocks yield higher power gain per swing; ensure requirement validation before starting auto-train.
