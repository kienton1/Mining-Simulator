- Vertical stat stack (top → bottom): Wins, Coins, Gems, Power, Rebirths.
- Green `+` button next to each stat opens boost/upgrade dialogs.
- Red buttons at bottom: `Auto Mine` (pickaxe icon) and `Auto Train` (power icon).
- Reward header at top shows limited-time bonus countdown (e.g., `14m 10s`).
- Use this reference when implementing the global HUD layout or styling.
